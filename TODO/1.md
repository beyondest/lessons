## Game basic logic :
 1. 单位进化体系：进化必须依靠战斗经验；高级召唤塔只可以提升基础属性或者加上buff，三阶召唤门并不能召唤三阶士兵
 2. Game statistic design
 3. Construction improve
 4. 黑暗势力多水晶，光明势力只有一个水晶，但可以有多个信标。

## Where to need sound effect:
 1. UI button 
 2. 每个单位的特殊动作是否需要配上音效？会不会很乱？projectile需要音效吗
   - 遇敌喇叭音效
   - 建筑被攻破音效
   - 单位死亡音效
   - 首次开采播放锄头音效
   - 某种资源增加的音效
 3. Command sound
   - march 音效
   - attack 音效
   - 升级建筑音效；回收建筑音效

  #### Art
- [ ] Change fog of war vfx
- [ ] Add construction animation and destroyed stage animation, vfx
  

### ✅ Done
- [x] Change resource material, add more resource prefabs
- [x] Add unit destroy animation and vfx
- [x] Change selection vfx, add march, attack, garrison vfx;
- [x] !!! Sight limitation : How should you use the fog of war with gameplay?
- [x] Construction system extension : Add construction attack range preview; Add truly constructable plane preview; Add construction snap support; Add recycle and delete support; Add constructable area visualization support(A green square, center is core crystal); Change constructable detection : Around crystal range; not the constructable tile; Add construction time support;
- [x] !!! Add animation system
- [x] Add minimap camera render texture by a top orientation camera and add ally, enemy, resource sprite renderer in specific layer for minimap
- [x] Add construct crystal function to change occupied grid material and tag
- [x] Add crystal turn plane preview
- [x] When population is full, enemy should stop spawn unit
- [x] Fix the UI window response in gameplay (ESC to exit etc.)
- [x] When spawn resource and env, random set their direction; After random spawn, make sure there is nothing overlapped

# 🐞 Bugs / Fix

### ⏳ Todo 

- [ ] Change the resource spawn system based on game waves, not on time points
- [ ] Garrison unit will keep extra unit amount in garrison building data when player upgrade the garrison building.
- [ ] Close up camera cannot follow target very fast. Add some control mechanism;

### ✅ Done
- [x] Building ghost preview reference sometimes reference to the wrong material, i do not know why. This only happens 
  sometimes, replay may solve this issue.
- [x] Cost slots show in UI Window is always stuck at the first time, try solve that
- [x] Healer cannot move with attackers when player command them to attack someone.
- [x] Enemy-crystal interaction fixed: AI was dropping aggro when too far, but target remained in list, causing stuck interact state.
- [x] Fixed the AI Follow, make it more fluential.
- [x] !!! Add the intialization signal when game start, add initalization functino of each system. Random seed should be set in the initialization function to garentee each time the game start with the different seed.
- [x] Fix the shader effects when 2 crystal is building near.
- [x] When move the building, its obstacle is not sync with the movement;
- [x] When game restarted, initialize function works fine for now.

# 🧪 Test

### ⏳ Todo
- [ ] Test the inverse fow agent for eldergrove plants
- [ ] !!!Test and design the best game statistic for unit hp, movement speed, etc.
- [ ] Test the camera limitation
- [ ] Test the crystal change effect when 2 crystal is near
- [ ] Test the generator building function, garrison to generate, more workers to generate faster, below the threshold cannot generate.
- [ ] Test population resource management, test the extreme case : population full, empty, etc.

### ✅ Done
- [x] Test move the building will move the obstacle
- [x] Test garrison state machine logic (especially out-of-range behavior) : Basic test passed, fix garrison system update sequence .
- [x] Test HP regeneration system
- [x] Target choosing system basic test passed.
- [x] Test harvesting system and resource regeneration system
- [x] Enemy AI Basic function passed. Further test need?
- [x] Test the intialization system
