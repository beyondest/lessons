### **What is PBR?**

**PBR** stands for **Physically Based Rendering**, a rendering approach used in 3D graphics to simulate materials and lighting in a way that mimics how they behave in the real world. It focuses on achieving realistic lighting and material interactions by adhering to physical principles.

#### **Key Features of PBR:**
1. **Physically Accurate Shading:**
   - Materials in PBR are designed to react realistically to light, whether it's reflections, refractions, or scattering.

2. **Energy Conservation:**
   - A surface cannot reflect more light than it receives, maintaining realistic brightness and color balance.

3. **Environment-Driven Lighting:**
   - HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging) maps and realistic light sources are often used to illuminate the scene, making reflections and lighting dynamic and natural.

4. **Consistency Across Platforms:**
   - PBR materials look consistent under different lighting conditions and in various rendering engines (Unity, Unreal, Blender, etc.).

### **PBR Components**
PBR materials are typically created using two main workflows:

#### 1. **Metallic/Roughness Workflow:**
   - **Base Color (Albedo):**
     - The primary color of the material without any lighting or shading effects.
   - **Metallic:**
     - Determines whether the surface is a metal (1.0) or non-metal (0.0).
   - **Roughness:**
     - Controls the smoothness of the surface. Lower values make it smooth and shiny; higher values make it rough and diffuse.
   - **Normal Map:**
     - Adds surface detail (e.g., bumps and scratches) without increasing polygon count.
   - **Ambient Occlusion (AO):**
     - Simulates soft shadows in crevices to add depth and realism.
   - **Height/Displacement Map (Optional):**
     - Adds height variations for more realistic surface detail.
   - **Emission:**
     - Makes parts of the material appear self-illuminated.

#### 2. **Specular/Glossiness Workflow:**
   - Similar to the above but uses **Specular** instead of Metallic and **Glossiness** instead of Roughness.

### **Comparison: PBR vs Material vs Texture vs Model**

| **Aspect**          | **PBR**                                                                 | **Material**                                                                                 | **Texture**                                                                                          | **Model**                                   |

| **Definition**       | A rendering method for simulating realistic materials and lighting.     | A collection of properties (e.g., textures, colors) applied to a 3D object's surface.       | A 2D image used to add details (color, patterns, etc.) to a surface.                                  | A 3D object made of vertices, edges, and faces. |
| **Purpose**          | Achieve realistic lighting and material behavior.                      | Define the appearance of an object's surface.                                               | Provide visual details to a material (e.g., brick pattern).                                           | Represent the shape and structure of an object. |
| **Components**       | Uses Albedo, Roughness, Metallic, etc., to simulate realism.            | Includes textures, shaders, and procedural properties.                                       | Includes color maps, bump maps, normal maps, etc.                                                     | Includes geometry, UV mapping, and rigging.    |
| **Level of Realism** | Physically accurate lighting and reflections.                          | Depends on the shader and settings; can be realistic or stylized.                           | Textures alone do not simulate lighting; realism depends on how they're used in materials or shaders. | Realism depends on topology and textures.     |
| **Usage**            | Found in modern game engines and rendering software like Unreal, Unity, Blender. | Applied to models to define how they interact with light and shading.                        | Used within materials to add details, patterns, or colors.                                            | Provides the base structure for applying materials and textures. |
| **Examples**         | Shiny metal, rough wood, wet asphalt.                                  | Glass material, glowing material.                                                           | Brick texture, wood grain, leather.                                                                   | A car, tree, or human figure.                 |

### **How PBR Works with Textures, Materials, and Models**

1. **Textures in PBR:**
   - PBR relies on multiple texture maps (e.g., Albedo, Roughness, Metallic) to define material properties.
   - These textures are combined in a shader to simulate real-world surfaces.

2. **Materials in PBR:**
   - A PBR material is essentially a collection of textures and properties configured to interact with light realistically.
   - Example: A gold material would have a yellow Albedo map, high Metallic value, and low Roughness.

3. **Models in PBR:**
   - PBR materials and textures are applied to 3D models to give them a realistic appearance.
   - Example: A 3D model of a sword with PBR materials can have a shiny blade and a rough leather handle.

### **Why Use PBR?**
- **Realism:** Ideal for realistic renders in games, movies, and visualization.
- **Consistency:** Looks the same across different software and lighting conditions.
- **Efficiency:** Simplifies lighting setups, reducing the need for manual tweaking.
